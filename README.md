* mean = average
* median = middle value from sorted data
* mode = most count value

### Variance
Measeures how spread out the data is.

(1,4,5,8)
Steps:
* find the mean (1+4+5+8)/4 = 4.5
* find difference from mean (-3.5,-0.5,0.5,3.5)
* find squred difference (12.25,0.25,0.25,12.25)
* find average of squared (12.25+0.25+0.25+12.25)/4 = 6.25

### Standard deviation

square root of variance

### Population vs Sample
Population if you take all of the data points.
Sample just a subset of the dataset = sample variance (devide by total - 1)
